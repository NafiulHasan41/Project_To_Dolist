# ToDoList 

This application functions as a note-taking app, allowing users to create personalized to-do lists by capturing simple notes. These notes are editable and can be deleted upon completion. Users have the capability to search for specific notes through the designated search section and can enhance their notes by incorporating images and URLs. Each note comprises three sections: Note title, Note subtitle, and Note content. The app features a bottom navigation bar on the 'add note' activity page, providing users with options to add images, insert URLs, change the note's color, and delete previously created notes.
